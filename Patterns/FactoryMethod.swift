    • The factory method selects or creates the correct implementation class/structure which is exposed
      to calling components as an abstract protocol (i.e. components do not know which class is returned).

    • Keeps client-supplier relationships loosely coupled and knowledge of public interfaces to a minimum.
    • Simplifies creational logic for many sub-types by consolidating it in a single method.

    •

    T I P S   &   C A V E A T S
    • "Class clusters" is a similar pattern, as the concrete classes are hidden and clients work only with a common interface.
