    • The singleton pattern ensures that only one object of a given type exists in the application

    B E N E F I T S
    • Encapsulates shared and global resources (such as logging, analytics or app preferences) that should be handled consistently throughout the app.
    • Mimics a resource (such as a server, printer or current device) that could not exist apart from it's real-world counterpart.

    • Conform to the Singleton protocol even though it doesn't do anything right now.
    • Examples can be found in the PatternsExample project.

    • Keep singletons thread-safe so that they can be used efficiently.
    • Singletons should not be copyable.
    • Do not use singletons to pass global state. One exception to this may be user preferences, but these should be read only and potentially abstracted into a service layer.
